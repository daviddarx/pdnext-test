Veteran performers Bishop Black and Jamal Phoenix explore D/s through breath, gently but firmly putting Jamal’s limits to the test in a gorgeous demonstration of trust and control. An immersive performance with a live audience as part of Porny Days in Zurich, HELMAP explores the layers of intimacy, consent, identity, and voyeurism that go into creating an explicit film. ×</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>",
