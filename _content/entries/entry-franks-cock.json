  "desc": "<p>A four-sided exploration of AIDS, this first-person testament is at once raw, funny, and profoundly tragic. It traces the meeting of two lovers and the intensity of their sexual journeys, told through the voice of the one who remains. As he recounts their life together, the screen fractures into four simultaneous visions: the narrator himself, microscopic footage from inside the body, a montage of performance art, and fragments of gay porn. This split frame mirrors the virus’s relentless spread, multiplying its devastation into a dazzling phantasmagoria of desire and loss. What emerges is not just a story, but an elegy—an intimate monument to a friend.</p>",
