  "desc": "<p>Brazil's love motels are a haven where fantasy becomes reality. When the filmmaker's own date never shows up, she gets a fresh idea for a film instead.</p>\r\n<p>Filmed collaboratively with the participants themselves, Eros presents the unique and singular ways in which people conduct their intimate and romantic relationships and how these behaviours reflect broader social norms and realities.</p>\r\n<p>Highly personal and at times explicit, the result is a kaleidoscopic insight into a parallel world of human desire.</p>",
