  "desc": "<p>His name is Bob Wingate, but he’s better known as Mr. Bound &amp; Gagged. Together with Lee Clauss, his partner of over 30 years, they published and edited the gay pornographic magazine Bound &amp; Gagged from 1987-2005, and directed nearly forty videos featuring A-list gay pornstars of the nineties and early aughts. Now octo- and septua-genarians, the two New Yorkers venture to Chicago to go through their personal collections at the Leather Archives &amp; Museum (LA&amp;M), where they rediscover troves of stories from their lives making porn: correspondence with clergy; rarely-seen work by legendary gay artists and writers like Howard Cruse, Stanley Stellar, and Larry Townsend; radical political commentary about AIDS, state censorship, and modern conservatism; all interspersed with reams of explicit porn and hours of salacious tapes. Harsh critics of an American \"society which considers sex evil”, and once chastised by a U.S. senator who referred to their work as \"shocking and repulsive\", these elder lovers will be better remembered as stewards of a long-overlooked community of queer creatives and dissidents.</p>",
