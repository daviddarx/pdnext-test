  "desc": "<p>In the gardens of the Monastery of La Cartuja in Seville once lay the remains of Christopher Columbus, now kept in Seville Cathedral. In one of his earliest letters, the conquistador wrote that the Indigenous people walked naked and bore no weapons, making it easy to turn them into servants. This embodied performance sought to confront those words with the statue of a young Columbus that was installed in the gardens in 1887.</p>",
