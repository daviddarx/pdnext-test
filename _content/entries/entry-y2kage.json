  "desc": "<p>What is a virtual pet in an era of mass surveillance? Jack out of the Y2KAGE in this erotic hauntology film probing the persistent feedback loops of futureâ€™s past in our present, forces of technological dominance, and virtual pets unleashed! Y2K aesthetic is back in style. Beyond cyclical fashion, this texture of a futurism that never came to pass has found new resonance with an American youth living under a technologically dominated culture in 2025. Y2KAGE probes this persistent cultural feedback loop as both subject and style</p>",
