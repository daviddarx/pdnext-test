Von weiblicher Ejakulation, Bodypainting, Gruppensex und Intimrasur bis zu Safer Sex und tantrischen Positionen werden alle Möglichkeiten erklärt, um zur Sexgöttin zu werden.» \\\n \\\n• Xenia-Programm «erotisch, aber indiskret – nonstop – Lesbische Pornographie» – Mai 1996 \n\n**Director’s Disclaimer:**  *The Sluts and Goddess Workshop* was made in 1989/90. Much of the language and cultural understanding that is now commonplace did not exist or was not widely known at the time. As such, the film incorporates terms and images that are culturally appropriative and/or outdated. I have chosen to present this film, preserved in its original form, as an historical document of the times in which it was made. If I were to make this film today, I would do it very differently. I hope no one will be offended viewing this uncensored, original version. Please enjoy the film. -Annie Sprinkle",
