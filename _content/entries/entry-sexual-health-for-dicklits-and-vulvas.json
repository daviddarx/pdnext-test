  "desc": "From these questions, we developed a workshop divided into a first theoretical part of self-awareness, to understand, build and shape our own pleasure. A second, practical part will allow us to share practices, experiences and knowledge, through group games and exercises. A performative part will also take participants through a journey of safer sex and the discovery of non-binarity of the body.\n\nThe workshop contains **explicit nudity from the facilitators**, and can contain **explicit nudity**and**contact among participants**, *according to consent*.\n\n**About ANOmalie Collettive**\\\nThe workshop will be given by Nad (they) ANOmalie Collettive. ANOmalie deviates functions and destroys structures, giving no possibility of classification. The anus erases the line of gender, sex and sexuality and moves us into a space without centralization or hierarchies. Through queer sex education, performance and porn, we want everyone to become vehicles of anomaly, through the sharing of body, knowledge and practices. Let's build our own narratives and collectively learn, to create sex and porn which is freer and safer for everyone.\n\n**Details & Info**\n\n* **Language:** English\n* **Duration:** 3h\n* **For:** FLINTA\n* **Max. Participants:** 20\n* **Materials participants need/can bring:** Feel free to bring a water bottle and your favorite snacks to stay comfortable throughout the session. If you wish to explore nudity, please bring a blanket or towel to sit on. Wear whatever makes you feel most at ease—whether that means dressing up, dressing down, or simply choosing something that allows you to reflect, explore, and express yourself freely.",
