  "desc": "<p>Part-time sex worker, full-time chaos magnet, AP is convinced that the universe has it out for her... and she might be right. In this wild, unfiltered debut from writer/director/star Annapurna Sriram —AP seeks a cosmic reset after a tarot reader floating in a swamp tells her she needs $1,000 and a sacrificial lamb to lift her curse. Armed with neither, she meets up with her long-lost kindred spirit Danni, and together the two moped off on a bizarre quest through Trashtown USA —a dystopian, neon-drenched sprawl of strip clubs and urban decay, stocked with a series of assorted oddballs, Tom of Finland cops, and some all-too-familiar type clients. Fucktoys is rude, crude, unhinged, girlypop middle finger to filmic convention, and a comedic calling card for anyone who finds themself asking the question: am I cursed???</p>",
