  "desc": "<p>Catscan is a short experimental film made by Michelle Handelman and Monte Cazazza. With its grinding whiplash soundtrack and funky, grungy images, Catscan pictures sex as ritual and theater, with a perverse twist on the word, “pussy” literalizing and unmasking cliches of sexuality. A tongue-in-cheek homage to feline sexuality, cunnilingus and dairy products.</p>",
