Oscillating between what happens on and off the sex scene, it invites us into the performers’ intimate connection—their desires, their fantasies, and some incredibly hot, horny fuckery. It’s a piece that lets us taste the sweat of a body that fights cisnormativity, a fight that also happens through cinema. For us, it’s a love letter to the transmasculine body—fully giving itself to pleasure, to being worshipped, and to that gentle, tender dominance. For all of this, and for the way it disrupts and crosses the fixed categories of porn, the award for best short film goes to Crashpad Series: J London & Johnny Castro.\"*\n\n**A Special Mention (CHF 200) goes to:**\n\n**Pleasure Engineer by Christina Castalia**, NL 2025, 11min.\n\nWhat the jury is saying about the film:\n\n*\"Our special mention goes to a film in which a single woman turns a single room through a single camera perspective into a full universe of presence and pleasure. It’s a declaration of sex work activism told in bold first person which celebrates joyfulness in sex work while insisting on knowing one’s worth and boundaries with unwavering clarity. Through designing experiences with fierce control, the protagonist transforms intimacy into authorship. Its minimalist but immersive storytelling reveals how camming can be therapy and indeed  “save people’s lives!” Lastly, it’s a film that only came into being through the porn film festival ecology with a curator pushing the filmmaker to finally submit something. We’re so glad she followed that call and welcome this one-woman show powerhouse to our beloved community. We award our Special Mention to this unapologetic masterpiece of agency: Pleasure Engineer by Christina Castalia.\"*\n\n**And the Audience Award (CHF 300) goes to:**\n\n**Ansiedad (Anxiety) by Lola Pistola**, ES 2025, 5min.",
