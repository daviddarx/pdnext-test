  "desc": "As queer people we have to build our sex education for ourselves. We grow up thinking that practices outside of penetration and heterocis norm are risk-free, while barrier tools other than external condoms are unobtainable, expensive, rarely used both in porn and live. What do we consider to be safer sex between FLINTA people? How do we approach the topic of prevention with new people or in party settings? How do we integrate barriers and their materials within our erotic sexual imagery?",
